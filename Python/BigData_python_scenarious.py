BigData Scenarios 
"""
"""
Variables
1. Create 2 variables with x as 100 & y as 10 respectively and find the Multiplication and division of both and store in some val as z and z1.

x=100
y=10
z=x*y
z1=x/y
print(z)
print(z1)

2. Create a as 2000 and find the division of a by y (created in step 1) and reassign a with the divided result (200).

a=2000
print("Entered value is " , a)
y=10
a=int(a/y)
print("After operation " , a)


3. Prove Python is Dynamically Typed Language: Create x:int=100, then assign the x to y, but the datatype of y has to be of type string. (think about using some function like str()). Print the type of y and x

x:int=100
y:str=str(x)
print(type(x))
print(type(y))


4. Prove Python has dynamic inference feature 

x=5
print(type(x)) # without any datatype x is automatically identified as integer 
y="String"
print(type(y)) # without any datatype y is identified as string 


5. Prove Python is Strongly Typed Language

x = 18   # automatically x is identified as integer by python due to dynamix inference 
y = "2"

#Python's strong typing nature where operations between incompatible types result in errors
z=x+int(y) # converting the string to integer 

print( z ) # Here the operations cant be done because the x is integer and y is string 


6. Create variables a,b,c,d assigned with 10,20,30,40 respectively

a,b,c,d=10,20,30,40
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)


7. Prove Python variables are case sensitive

#These variable are case sensitive 
var=12 # var is a variable 
Var=23 # Var is another variable 
print(var)
print(Var)


8. Prove variable name can’t start with numbers or cannot contains special character other than _

#9var=34  The variable cant start with numbers

#$var=34  The variable cant start with special charecters 


9. Show some examples of when do we use single, double and triple (single/double) quotes

string1='Akshaya Baalaji'
print(string1) # with single quote
string2="Akshaya Baalaji"
print(string2) # with double quote which work as same as single quote
##string3="""#This is a multi line value 
#    HI 
#    Bye 
#    See 
#    you 
"""
print(string3) # for multi line value 


10. Show an examples to use arithmetic, comparison, relational and logical operators.

# Arithmetic operators
x = 10
y = 3

print("Arithmetic operators:")
print("x + y =", x + y)  # Addition
print("x - y =", x - y)  # Subtraction
print("x * y =", x * y)  # Multiplication
print("x / y =", x / y)  # Division
print("x // y =", x // y)  # Floor Division
print("x % y =", x % y)  # Modulus
print("x ** y =", x ** y)  # Exponentiation
print()

# Comparison operators
print("Comparison operators:")
print("x == y is", x == y)  # Equal to
print("x != y is", x != y)  # Not equal to
print("x > y is", x > y)  # Greater than
print("x < y is", x < y)  # Less than
print("x >= y is", x >= y)  # Greater than or equal to
print("x <= y is", x <= y)  # Less than or equal to
print()

# Relational operators
print("Relational operators:")
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
c = a
print("a is b is", a is b)  # Identity - checks if a and b reference the same object
print("a is c is", a is c)  # Identity - checks if a and c reference the same object
print("a == b is", a == b)  # Equality - checks if the values of a and b are the same
print()

# Logical operators
print("Logical operators:")
p = True
q = False
print("p and q is", p and q)  # Logical AND
print("p or q is", p or q)    # Logical OR
print("not p is", not p)       # Logical NOT


Conditional Structures

11. Write a program to find the greatest of 3 numbers

#using list built in functions 
make_list=[a,b,c] # making the list from the variables 
print(max(make_list));
#we can take the greatest by sorting and taking the last element in list 
make_list.sort(); #sort will sort the list 
print("Taking the last elemrent from the list ",make_list[-1])

#using simple conditional structure 
a=10
c=10
b=30
if a==b and a==c :
    print("All are same ")
elif a>=b and a>=c :
    print(a, " is the greatest ")
elif b>=a and b>=c :
    print(b, " is the greatest ")
else :
    print(c, " is the greatest ")

#using nested conditional structure 
a=900
b=900
c=100

if a==b and b==c:
    print("All are same ")
else :
    if a>=b and a>=c:
        print("A is greater ")
    elif b>=a and b>=c :
        print("B is greater ")
